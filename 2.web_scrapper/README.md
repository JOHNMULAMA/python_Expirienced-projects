This code requests a website's content using the requests library and parses the HTML content using the BeautifulSoup library. It then finds all links on the page using the find_all() method and appends them to a list. Finally, it prints the list of links. You can customize this code according to your web scraping requirements. However, it's important to note that web scraping may not be legal in all cases, so be sure to check the website's terms and conditions before scraping their content
