This code generates a pie chart using the pie() method of the matplotlib library. It uses the labels and values lists to define the data for the chart. It then sets the title of the chart using the title() method. Finally, it saves the chart to a file using the savefig() method. You can customize this code according to your chartbot requirements and generate different types of charts (e.g., bar charts, line charts, etc.) using the matplotlib library.
