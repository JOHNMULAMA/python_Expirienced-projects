This code generates a sine wave plot using the plot() function from Matplotlib library. The x and y data are generated using NumPy library's arange() and sin() functions, respectively. The plot title and labels for x and y axes are set using title(), xlabel(), and ylabel() functions. Finally, the plot is displayed using the show() function. You can customize this code according to your data and plot requirements.
